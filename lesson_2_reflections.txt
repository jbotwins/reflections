What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  It depends, but most likely the command creates a hidden directory with some initial meta data about your repository. Probably some paths and some default schema. Initializing the repository is required because the OS doesn't do it for you in a way that is compatible with coding workflows.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area is more abstract than the working directory and seems to be the intermediary space for versions of files on their way into a repository. There may be an analogy available with a shipping and recieving dock, maybe.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

  The staging area is an intermediary space in which you can assess and commit a file at a time to the repository. It's super useful.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

  Branches are helpful for larger deviations in the direction or offerings of the product. A project may not have a linear progression of how it evolves and branches allow for storing that value.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

  They help you understand the power and limitations of the git commands that one can run. They help to describe the inner workings of how git is built to navigate a repository history.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

  The result is one set of files without merge conflicts. To have a sense of how features integrate into more final drafts.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
